# LFR-Code
autonomous robot which follows a line until that line exists. Generally, the line is drawn on the floor. It can be either black or white. The robot follows the line by using Infra-Red Ray (IR) sensors. These sensors read the line and send that reading to Arduino and then control the robot movement.
